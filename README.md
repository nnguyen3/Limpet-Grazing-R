## üêö Limpet Grazing on Microalgae ‚Äì R Analysis

These data are from LaScala-Gruenewald et al. 2016, Marine Ecology Progress Series http://doi.org/10.3354/meps11774

This repository contains R code and data used to analyze the effects of limpet grazing on microalgal communities in the upper intertidal zone
# Summary
The study explore how limpet grazing effect the microalgae community

# Required Files
microalgae_community_SEM_data.csv: Dataset with percent cover of microalgae morphotypes from SEM imaging.
LaScala-Gruenewald_etal_MEPS_2016.pdf: Source paper describing the experimental setup and findings.

# Methods
- Statistical Analysis: NMDS, PERMANOVA, CLR tranformation, PCA on clr, Alpha diversity
- Transformations: CLR transformation
- Diversity Metrics: Richness and composition of microalgae morphotypes analyzed.
- Visualization: Barplots, and ordination plots created with vegan and ggplot2.
